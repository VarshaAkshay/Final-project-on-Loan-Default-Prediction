 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhil1e9/loan-default â€“ Summary ðŸ”¹ Introduction Loans are a vital part of the banking system, but loan defaults cause major losses for financial institutions. This project uses data analytics to analyze borrower characteristics (such as income, credit score, loan amount, and employment details) to understand and predict the likelihood of loan default. ðŸ”¹ Dataset 1)Source: Kaggle 2)Rows: ~322,375 3)Columns: 18, provided column wise description. 4)Includes demographic, financial, and loan-related information. ðŸ”¹ Process Followed ->Data Loading & Overview 1)Imported dataset using Pandas. 2)Checked dimensions, column names, and data types. ->Data Cleaning & Preprocessing 1)Handled missing values. 2)Corrected data types. 3)Removed unnecessary symbols (e.g., # in categorical columns). 4)Removing Multiple Spaces, Leading /Trailing Spaces(Stripping),Changing to Proper Cases. 5)Remving duplicates. 6)Created derived columns where required and also filtering data. 7)Aggregating data. ->Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 1)Univariate analysis: Histograms, count plot for individual features. 2)Bivariate analysis: count plot and box blot for two features. 3)Multivariate analysis: stacked bar chart, box plots to study multiple variables together. 4)Groupyby, pivot tables and correlation analysis with violin plot and heat map. ->Visualization Techniques 1)Histograms, line charts and pie charts. 2)Provided interpretations/observations for each visualization. ->Recommendations 1)Identified high-risk borrower segments (e.g., low income, poor credit scores). 2)Highlighted patterns in loan purposes and repayment. 3)Suggested strategies for banks to minimize risk, such as stricter credit checks and targeted lending policies. ðŸ”¹ Conclusion This project demonstrates the full data analytics workflow: from raw dataset â†’ cleaning â†’ exploratory analysis â†’ visualization â†’ recommendations. The findings provide valuable inputs for risk assessment and decision-making in the lending process.
